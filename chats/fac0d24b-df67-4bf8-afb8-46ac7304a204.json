Here are some minor improvements for consideration:\n\n### Python Version\n\n```python\ndef hello():\n    \"\"\"Prints 'Hello' to the console.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Hello\")\n```\n\n*   Added a docstring to provide context about what the `hello` function does.\n*   Used consistent naming conventions (e.g., underscore-separated words).\n\n### JavaScript Version\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Prints 'Hello' to the console.\n */\nfunction hello() {\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n}\n```\n\n*   Added a JSDoc comment for documentation purposes.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nTo further enhance maintainability and readability, consider using more descriptive variable names or function parameters if necessary. However, in this specific case, the code is straightforward and easy to understand.\n\nIf you'd like me to analyze more complex scenarios or provide additional suggestions, please let me know!",
